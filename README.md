# Selenium-Automation
This repository contains example Sanitized Test Cases and demonstrates how to organize code into different packages and call classes from one package in another using a Page Object Model (POM) pattern.

## Structure
`com.example.automationFramework.pages` contains the POMs.
`com.example.automationFramework.tests` contains the test classes that call methods from the POM classes.
